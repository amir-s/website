# Shir Ya Khat
This is the repository for Shir Ya Khat website.

[Shir Ya Khat](http://shiryakhat.net) podcast, which translates to Head or Tails, started its non-profit mission in early 2017.

The Vision of Shir Ya Khat is open and free information for all, similar to [Coiniran](https://coiniran.com)

The main goal is to remove the language barrier in order to allow the knowledge on blockchain and decentralization to be accessible to Farsi speakers, and offer a global open platform for people to discuss related subjects.
